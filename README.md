## PyPost
### About
PyPost is a simple web app that allows users to easily send code from one place to another. It is called pypost because the server was written in python using flask. The frontend is react + astro. 

### Use
I wrote this app for a summer camp I organized at my local library. At the camp I taught programming basics with python. The app allowed attendees to quickly send me their code so that we could debug any issues are discuss their solution as a class.
The app allows for basic crud operations and all data is stored temporarily in memory using a python dictionary (hashmap). When the server spins down all data is lost. 

**This is a utility app and it was not designed to store data securely. Use at your own risk. Do not share sesnsitive data.**
